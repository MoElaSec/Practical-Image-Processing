# Practical_Img_Proc
- A small part of my journey through Image Processing In Practice - great as an Intro to OpenCV 

---
### ðŸ¥¼ Labs:

##### 1. Introduction
  * What is the image processing?
  * C vs C++ ([think c++](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-c/))
  * Getting started with OpenCV
  * Loading and displaying an image
  * The Mat class (image)
  * How to access pixels of images? (the img.at<>() template function) 
  
##### 2. Color models
  * Using RGB color model to select pixels by range
  * Using HSV color model to select pixels by rangel
  * Using Lab color space to measuring color difference of images

##### 3. Image enhancement
  * Histogram transforms:
    * contrast stretching
    * histogram equalization
    * histogram equalization a color image
  * Noise reduction methods


##### 4. Threshold



##### 5.



##### 6. Working with contours



##### 7. Features, unsupervised learning (K-means)
